mid level tutorial set. way over my head for now

## Qs

* can you pass test data into a layer directly without it being in a model?
* what are non-trainable params (from the model.summary() info)

## Terms


## Deep Learning Building Blocks: Intro

standardizing / normalizing

## Deep Learning on Normal Data

data that can fit in a table

## How to do Deep Learning with Categorical Data

Data that's none numeric like


## Variable Length Features and Deep Learning

i.e. records with different number of fields
i.e. training on a dataset of peoples credit cards where the number of cards is different per person

linear regresion, you have to cap the max number of coeficients upfront
convolutional layer
batches have to have the same number of features i.e. only people with 3 credit cards

## How to do Deep Learning with Ordered Variable Length Features

batch based sampling
RNN
GRU (gated recurrent unit)

## Deep Learning with Real World Examples

embeddings
