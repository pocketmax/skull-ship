SKIPPED

2 Adding/Subtracting negative numbers
SKIPPED

3 Multiplying and dividing negative numbers

Multiplying
Same signs = Positive
Different signs = Negative

Dividing
Same signs = Positive
Different signs = Negative

4 Adding and subtracting fractions

Least common multiple…. Can’t you just multiple both denominators? Nope because you’re multiplying two pies with different sized slices

adding…
If denominators are the same. Just copy the denominator and add the numerators

If denominators are different. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of both fractions and then add across

1. 1		3   2
   -+ -    -> - + -
   2  3		6   6

* You have to get the denominators the same before you do anything

subtracting…
If denominators are the same. Just copy the denominator and add the numerators

2     1        1
— - —   =  -
5     5       5

If denominators are different. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of both fractions and then add across

4   2		12   4
—- -    -> - - -
2   3		6   6

* You have to get the denominators the same before you do anything

5 Multiplying fractions

Just multiply across

6 dividing fractions

Flip the second term
Then change to multi

7 Intro To Order of operations

Parentheses
Exponents
Mult & Div
Add & Sub
Note: Mult & Div can be done in any order but is preferred to do from left to right if on the same level

8 Order of operations: PEMDAS
