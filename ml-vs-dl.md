AI: lets machines think
* ML: statistical tools to explore the data
    * “Algorithms that gives the ability to learn from data and make predictions”
    * Supervised ML
    * Unsupervised ML
    * Reinforcement (semi-supervised) learning
    * DL:
        * ANN: artificial neural network
        * CNN
        * RNN
