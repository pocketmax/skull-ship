the four stages to go from beginner to expert
1. Unconscious Incompetence (you don't know why you're bad)
2. Conscious Incompetence (you know why you're bad)
3. Conscious Competence (you're good, but require effort)
4. Unconscious Competence (you're good without any effort)

* OCR receipt scanner




x = dependant variable i.e. feature. The values to test against
y = independant variable the values to test against during training

x_train = dependant variable to train from i.e. feature
y_train = independant variable to compare to during training
x_test = dependant variable to test against after model is complete
y_test = independant variable to check against after model is complete

# Types of AI
* text classification
* object dectection

# AI need can be done in more then one type of NN. i.e. text classification can be done in a NLP or LSTM etc etc 

cross validation?
# stack overflow questions
a hello world auto keras example?
why xtrain, ytrain, xtest, ytest

# Things to keep in mind when learning
* avoid the rabbit hole of focusing on connected topics that get progressivly less relative
* notice hidden connective subjects that are required for the tutorial but arn't focused on like a system function being used but not metioned
* find ways to add exta features to example that enhance the value of the tutorial

# Stack overflow questions

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78096989/binary-classifier-with-only-positive-training-data
* AI - Is it possible to train a binary classifier with only positive training data? All the examples I've seen have you train positive and negative records in the training set. And if so can someone send a link?

* sklearn.datasets.load_files - how are the elements in the target array created? At first glance they look random based on the categories array

* AI - Is there a difference between a binary classifier and a multi-class classifer with only 2 classes? from the looks of it, it's just a naming difference. You can accomplish the same thing with a multi-class with 1 class

* AutoKeras - When using the TextClassifier to train a model with trials, is it possible to get the chosen hyper paremeiters from the trails?

* keras - diff between keras auto tuner and auto keras trails

# passive TODO list. Things to do for every tutorial
* reduce code complexity
  - rename confusing vars
  - lean on defaults and drop explicit args
* compare accuracy of multiple models
* DONE print first records of x_train and y_train
