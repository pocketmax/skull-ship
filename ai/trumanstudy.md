# I find a course, solid instructor, someone I can understand / enjoy listening to
 
 # Round 1:: The goal here is to be open, thoughtless and to be a sponge. I watch the course like sitting in a lecture hall, noise cancelling heads phones on, water, sitting on my hands if I have to. This is really hard when starting new languages because you have to go through the variables and methods lectures, but I always find something new and beneficial. I usually watch until I can't handle any more new concepts, generally it's 2-5 sections worth depending on the course. This generally takes about 1 week.

# Rest Day, this is the digestion period, allow my brain to soak up the information dump.

# Round 2:: This is the most exciting, this is when I start the course over again while also trying to code along with the instructor. Feel free to pause during these sessions to take the time to type so you aren't rushing. Sometimes I listen to the instructor at 0.75x speed to help.

# Round 3:: Test ya knowledge, sharpen your axe. This time it's all about you discovering your weak points. I generally will go by video topic name "Methods" write a method, test it, make sure it works, explain to myself what i'm doing at why aloud. Sometimes I'll go to the end of the section where they have project/test questions and try to complete those without watching the video. It's important here to be honest in critiquing yourself, if I stubble or stutter on a concept I just rewatch the video or section. A lot of times, after realizing i'm struggling I'll take notes and also verbally explain what I'm learning to myself so I can adhere to more brain mapping.


At this point I have one of two options after I've done this for the first sections of interests. I either start a project based on my own understanding or find the next batch of sections i.e. section 5-8, rinse and repeat the process. 

The goal here is to not finish an entire course, it's to get enough wind under your wings to start making your own projects, then using the rest of the course in the above fashion to help you with more intermediate and advanced topics as needed
